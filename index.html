                                 ISSUE SUMMARY

        YES: Thomas Kidd insists that preachers such as George Whiteﬁeld
        engineered a powerful series of revivals in the mid-eighteenth cen-
        tury that inﬂuenced all of the British North American colonies and
        gave birth to a spirit of evangelicalism that initiated a major altera-
        tion of global Christian history.
        NO: Jon Butler claims that to describe the religious revival activities
        of the eighteenth century as the “Great Awakening” is to seriously
        exaggerate their extent, nature, and impact on prerevolutionary
        American society and politics.

        A     lthough generations of American schoolchildren have been taught that
the British colonies in North America were founded by persons ﬂeeing reli-
gious persecution in England, the truth is that many of those early settlers
were motivated by other factors, some of which had little to do with theologi-
cal preferences. To be sure, the Pilgrims and Puritans of New England sought
to escape the proscriptions established by the Church of England. Many New
Englanders, however, did not adhere to the precepts of Calvinism and there-
fore were viewed as outsiders. The Quakers who populated Pennsylvania were
mostly fugitives from New England, where they had been victims of reli-
gious persecution. But to apply religious motivations to the earliest settlers of
Virginia, South Carolina, or Georgia is to engage in a serious misreading of the
historical record. Even in New England, the religious mission of Massachusetts
Bay Colony Governor John Winthrop’s “city upon a hill” began to erode as the
colonial settlements matured and stabilized.
   Although religion was a central element in the lives of the seventeenth-
and eighteenth-century Europeans who migrated to the New World, prolif-
eration of religious sects and denominations, emphasis upon material gain
in all parts of the colonies, and the predominance of reason over emotion
that is associated with the Deists of the Enlightenment period all contributed
to a gradual but obvious movement of the colonists away from the church
and clerical authority. William Bradford of Plymouth Colony, for example,
expressed grave concern that many Plymouth residents were following a path
of perﬁdy, and Pennsylvania founder William Penn was certain that the “holy
experiment” of the Quakers had failed. Colonial clergy, fearful that a fall from
grace was in progress, issued calls for a revival of religious fervor. The spirit of
revivalism that spread through the colonies in the 1730s and 1740s, therefore,
was an answer to these clerical prayers.
   The episode known as the First Great Awakening coincided with the Pie-
tistic movement in Europe and England and was carried forward by dynamic
preachers such as Gilbert Tennant, Theodore Frelinghuysen, and George
Whiteﬁeld. They promoted a religion of the heart, not of the head, in order
to produce a spiritual rebirth. These revivals, most historians agree, reinvigor-
ated American Protestantism. Many new congregations were organized as a
result of irremediable schisms between “Old Lights” and “New Lights.” Skep-
ticism about the desirability of an educated clergy sparked a strong strain of
anti-intellectualism. Also, the emphasis on conversion was a message to which
virtually everyone could respond, regardless of age, sex, race, or social status.
   For some historians, the implications of the Great Awakening extended
beyond the religious sphere into the realm of politics and were incorporated
into the American Revolution. William G. McLoughlin’s essay “‘Enthusiasm
for Liberty’: The Great Awakening as the Key to the Revolution,” in Jack P.
Greene and William G. McLoughlin, eds., Preachers & Politicians: Two Essays
on the Origins of the American Revolution (American Antiquarian Society, 1977)
claims that the Great Awakening paved the way for the American Revolution
by promoting religious revitalization, intercolonial unity, and democracy. In
his book Religion in America: Past and Present (Prentice-Hall, 1961), Clifton E.

             Olmstead argues for a broader application of religious causes to the origins of
 the American Revolution. First, and consistent with McLoughlin and others,
 Olmstead contends that the Great Awakening did foster a sense of community
 among American colonists, thus providing the unity required for an organ-
 ized assault on English control. Moreover, the Awakening further weakened
 existing ties between colonies and Mother Country by drawing adherents of
 the Church of England into the evangelical denominations that expanded as
 a result of revivalist Protestantism. Second, tensions were generated by the
 demand that an Anglican bishop be established in the colonies. Many evan-
 gelicals found in this plan evidence that the British government wanted fur-
 ther control over the colonies. Third, the Quebec Act, enacted by Parliament
 in 1774, not only angered American colonists by nullifying their claims to
 western lands, but also heightened religious prejudice in the colonies by grant-
 ing tolerance to Roman Catholics. Fourth, ministers played a signiﬁcant role
 in encouraging their parishioners to support the independence movement.
 Olmstead claims that Congregationalist, Presbyterian, Dutch Reformed, and
 Baptist ministers overwhelmingly defended this revolutionary movement in
 the colonies. Finally, many of the revolutionaries, imbued with the Ameri-
 can sense of mission, believed that God was ordaining their revolutionary
 activities.
        Further support for these views can be found in Alan Heimert, Religion and
 the American Mind from the Great Awakening to the Revolution (Cambridge Uni-
 versity Press, 1966); Cedric B. Cowing, The Great Awakening and the American
 Revolution: Colonial Thought in the Eighteenth Century (University of Chicago,
 1971); Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (Knopf, 1973); Rhys
 Isaac, The Transformation of Virginia, 1740–1790 (University of North Carolina
 Press, 1982); Ruth H. Bloch, Visionary Republic (Cambridge University Press,
 1985); Patricia U. Bonomi, Under the Cope of Heaven: Religion, Society, and Poli-
 tics in Colonial America (Oxford University Press, 1986); Harry S. Stout, The New
 England Soul: Preaching and Religious Culture in Colonial New England (Oxford
 University Press, 1986); and Mark A. Noll, Christians in the American Revolution
 (Regent College Publishing, 2006). Jon Butler has expanded his views on the
 colonial religious experience in Awash in a Sea of Faith: Christianizing the Ameri-
 can People (Harvard University Press, 1990).
        In the following selections, Thomas S. Kidd writes from the traditional
 assumption that a powerful revivalist force known as the “Great Awakening”
 occurred in the American colonies in the mid-eighteenth century. Recognizing
 that these revivals began before 1740 and continued well into the Revolution-
 ary era, Kidd focuses on the activities of George Whiteﬁeld in the early 1740s.
 In his essay, Kidd challenges Jon Butler’s contention that the inﬂuence of the
 Great Awakening was limited to New England and produced little change in
 colonial American religion. In contrast, Kidd argues that the Great Awakening
 produced a powerful impact in the colonies and sparked a rise in evangelical
 fervor that would have signiﬁcant implications for global Christianity.
        Jon Butler claims that historians, by accepting without much question
 the existence of the Great Awakening, have become accomplices in Napoleon’s
 insistence that “history is fable agreed upon.” Closer scrutiny of these revivals,

        says Butler, reveals that they were regional episodes that did not affect all of
the colonies equally and, hence, had only a modest impact on American colo-
nial religion. Because the mid-eighteenth-century revivals did not produce
the kinds of dramatic changes—religious or political—frequently ascribed
to them, Butler suggests that historians should abandon the concept of the
“Great Awakening” altogether.

    The Great Awakening: The Roots
     of Evangelical Christianity in
           Colonial America

 ...  U   ntil 1982, historians took the Great Awakening as a given, but then
 historian Jon Butler argued that it was only an “interpretative ﬁction” invented
 by nineteenth-century Christian historians. Although Butler’s argument was
 overextended, it helpfully provoked a revaluation of what we actually mean by
 “the Great Awakening.” He contended that the event really amounted to just
 “a short-lived Calvinist revival in New England during the early 1740s.” No
 doubt the eighteenth-century awakenings were centered in New England, but
 over time they came to inﬂuence parts of all the colonies, and more important,
 they helped birth an enormously important religious movement, evangelical-
 ism, which shows no sign of disappearing today.
       Butler also asserted that the “revivals had modest effects on colonial reli-
 gion” and that they were “never radical.” But if the revivals helped create
 evangelicalism, then not only did the awakenings make a profound change in
 colonial religion, but they began a major alteration of global Christian history.
 Moreover, . . . the revivals featured all manner of radical spiritual manifesta-
 tions, unnerving antirevivalists and moderate evangelicals alike. Butler’s critique
 does show, however, that it is not enough to evaluate evangelicalism as a
 homogenous whole. It had radical implications, but those implications were
 hotly contested by moderates, and its social potential often came to naught
 for women, African Americans, and Native Americans. Some evangelicals also
 began a great assault on the churchly establishments of colonial America, and
 the revolutionary move for disestablishment on the federal and state levels
 can largely be attributed to evangelical and deist cooperation in favor of the
 separation of church and state.
       Butler ﬁnally claimed that, contrary to the suggestions of previous schol-
 ars, “the link between the revivals and the American Revolution is virtually
 nonexistent.” . . . I am in substantial agreement with Butler on this point.
 Moreover, evangelicals’ responses to the Revolution covered the whole range of
 opinions from enthusiastic Patriotism to staunch Loyalism. But we should also
 note that evangelical rhetoric and ideology helped to inspire and justify the
 Patriot cause for both evangelical and nonevangelical leaders. Evangelicalism

did not start the Revolution, but the Patriot side certainly beneﬁted from the
support of many evangelicals.
  . . . I contend that there was, indeed, a powerful, unprecedented series
of revivals from about 1740 to 1743 that touched many of the colonies and
that contemporaries remembered for decades as a special visitation of the
Holy Spirit. Calling this event “the” Great Awakening does present historical
problems. Chief among them is that the standard framework of the “First”
and “Second” Great Awakenings may obscure the fact that the evangelical
movement continued to develop after 1743 and before 1800. There were
important, widespread revivals that happened before the First, and between
the First and Second, Great Awakenings. . . . I examine, instead, what we
might call the long First Great Awakening and the contest to deﬁne its bound-
aries. Although many revivals, including the major season from 1740 to 1743,
happened during this period, revivals alone did not delineate the early evan-
gelical movement. Instead, persistent desires for revival, widespread indi-
vidual conversions, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit distinguished the
new evangelicals. The long First Great Awakening started before Jonathan
Edwards’s 1734–35 Northampton revival and lasted roughly through the end
of the American Revolution, when disestablishment, theological change, and
a new round of growth started the (even more imprecise) “Second” Great
Awakening. The controversial emergence of the religion of the new birth
demarcated the long First Great Awakening and the ﬁrst generation of
American evangelical Christianity.
  . . . New Englanders began to hear about George Whiteﬁeld in 1739,
and many hoped that he would soon visit them. Benjamin Colman of
Boston’s Brattle Street Church wrote to Whiteﬁeld in December 1739 after
having received a letter from him. Whiteﬁeld estimated that he might
come to New England by summer 1740. Colman was deeply impressed by
what he had learned about Whiteﬁeld. He had read Whiteﬁeld’s Journals,
as well as some of his sermons. Colman wrote that he had never encoun-
tered anything comparable to Whiteﬁeld’s ministry, although he had wit-
nessed “uncommon Operations of the holy Spirit . . . ; as in our Country of
Hampshire of late; the Narrative of which by Mr. Edwards, I suppose you may
have seen.” If Whiteﬁeld would come to New England, he would ﬁnd the
churches’ Calvinist doctrine to his liking, “how short soever we may come
of your Fervours.” Colman told him that the churches had been praying for
him publicly, and that when he arrived he could use the commodious Brattle
Street Church for meetings. In a letter to Gilbert Tennent, Whiteﬁeld wrote
that he found Colman’s published sermons “acute and pointed, but I think not
searching enough by many degrees.” If anything, Colman was too polite for
Whiteﬁeld. Nevertheless, Whiteﬁeld wrote back to Colman and promised that
when he came to New England “I shall endeavour to recommend an universal
charity amongst all the true members of CHRIST’s mystical body.” Because of
this universal spirit, he suggested that he might stay in the ﬁelds to preach,
and out of the meetinghouses. He appreciated Colman’s latitudinarianism,
and they both hoped that the old division of Anglican versus dissenter would
become irrelevant in light of the ministry of the new birth.

       Jonathan Edwards also received word of Whiteﬁeld’s revivals, and in
 November 1739 Whiteﬁeld wrote to him, desiring to visit Northampton to
 see for himself the fruit of the 1734–35 awakening. Edwards wrote back in
 February 1740, encouraging Whiteﬁeld to travel to Northampton but warning
 him not to expect much. Edwards was heartened by God’s raising up Whiteﬁeld
 in the Church of England “to revive the mysterious, spiritual, despised, and
 exploded doctrines of the gospel.” This might be a sign of the coming King-
 dom of God, Edwards thought.
       The Boston and Philadelphia newspapers began picking up stories about
 Whiteﬁeld’s prodigious meetings in England in spring 1739, and Whiteﬁeld’s
 fame began to spread into the hinterlands by early 1740. For instance, pastor
 Nicholas Gilman of Exeter, New Hampshire, on a visit to Boston, began reading
 Whiteﬁeld’s Journals in mid-January 1740 and commented with admiration on
 Whiteﬁeld’s “most Indefatigable labours to Advance the Kingdom of Christ.” He
 borrowed more of Whiteﬁeld’s sermons from Colman. In June, Gilman noted
 that “Mr. Whiteﬁeld [was] Now much the Subject of Conversations.”
       In July, Whiteﬁeld wrote to Colman to announce that he was coming soon,
 perhaps within a month, and to ask Colman to spread the word in friendly churches.
 This advance publicity worked wonderfully, and when Whiteﬁeld arrived in
 Newport. Rhode Island, on September 14, 1740, New England was abuzz with talk
 of his coming. In Newport, Whiteﬁeld was welcomed by Nathaniel Clap, a vener-
 able Congregational minister, and the wandering Jonathan Barber of Oysterponds,
 Long Island. Whiteﬁeld had earlier written the disconsolate Barber, telling him
 that he did not presume to judge whatever dealings God had with him. As for his
 visionary experiences, “I rather rejoice in them, having myself been blessed with
 many experiences of the like nature.” He told Barber to expect persecution when
 God dealt with him in extraordinary ways. These encouraging words led Barber
 to come to Newport to receive Whiteﬁeld. Upon meeting, they agreed that Barber
 would become part of Whiteﬁeld’s entourage.
       After some successes in preaching, particularly at Clap’s meetinghouse,
 Whiteﬁeld traveled north to Boston, where he arrived on September 18. Boston
 was the largest town in the colonies but still only a small provincial capital with
 about 17,000 people. In 1740, it was in decline, and it would slowly lose popu-
 lation up through the American Revolution. War with Spain, and later with
 France, left many widows in Boston, and the city faced high taxes and inﬂation.
 The poor in Boston were many, and they responded exuberantly to Whiteﬁeld,
 as they would to the radical piety of James Davenport and others.
       As usual, Whiteﬁeld met with Anglican authorities in Boston, most nota-
 bly the Commissary Timothy Cutler, the former Congregationalist rector of
 Yale turned Anglican “apostate.” Cutler was the most formidable proponent
 of Anglicanism in the colonies, and he and Whiteﬁeld did not see eye to eye
 about Whiteﬁeld’s relationship with non-Anglicans. Cutler argued that dis-
 senters had no legitimate ordination because they did not follow in the line
 of apostolic succession. Whiteﬁeld thought their ordinations were legitimate,
 primarily because they preached the new birth: “I saw regenerate souls among
 the Baptists, among the Presbyterians, among the Independents, and among
 the Church folks—all children of God, and yet all born again in a different




mad50316_issue05_097-122.indd 103                                                          25/01/12 6:45 PM

way of worship,” he told Cutler. Whiteﬁeld was able to leave Cutler on friendly
terms, but he would receive a much warmer welcome among the Congrega-
tionalists, especially from Benjamin Colman. After visiting Cutler he preached
at the Brattle Street Church to about four thousand.
  Whiteﬁeld spoke from supporters’ Boston pulpits as well as on Boston
Common. On September 20, he preached at Joseph Sewall’s Old South
Church to about six thousand, and in the afternoon he addressed a crowd
at the common that he estimated at eight thousand, although the papers
guessed ﬁve thousand. The next day he attended Sunday morning services at
the Brattle Street Church and spoke at Thomas Foxcroft’s Old Brick Church
in the afternoon. The crowd pressing to see him was so large that he went
out to the common again and preached to an enormous assembly he totaled
at ﬁfteen thousand, close to the whole population of Boston (the newspa-
pers guessed eight thousand). On Monday morning he sermonized at John
Webb’s New North Church to about six thousand. Then, in the afternoon,
tragedy struck the tour. At Samuel Checklcy’s New South Church, the sound
of a breaking board in the gallery triggered a stampede among the overﬂow
crowd. A number of people were severely trampled, and some jumped from
the balcony. Five people died. Whiteﬁeld decided to go on with the message
he planned to deliver, only moving out to the common. No doubt this sug-
gested insensitivity in Whiteﬁeld’s character, but the crowd wanted him to go
on, and one could hardly imagine a better moment for people to contemplate
their mortality.
  Whiteﬁeld visited Harvard and was not impressed with the size of the
school or its spirit. He noted that “bad books,” such as those by John Tillotson
and Samuel Clarke, defenders of natural religion, were popular there, not the
Puritan classics. Whiteﬁeld would later regret his harsh assessment of Harvard
and Yale and would become a great supporter of the colleges. Whiteﬁeld also
toured neighboring towns, including Roxbury and Charlestown, in his cir-
cuit. On September 27, Whiteﬁeld preached to one of his greatest crowds yet,
ﬁfteen thousand, on the common. Many were deeply affected, and Whiteﬁeld
himself wrote that he felt like shouting, “This is no other than the House
of God and the Gate of Heaven.” Boston Common had become a portal to
divine glory.
  Whiteﬁeld began taking collections for the Bethesda Orphanage, and the
number of pounds given was truly remarkable: perhaps £3,000 in local currency.
Boston outpaced collections even in London. On September 28 alone, he col-
lected more than £1,000 in services at the Old South and Brattle Street churches.
After speaking at Brattle Street in the afternoon, Whiteﬁeld held two private
meetings that showed the breadth of his appeal. The ﬁrst was with the governor,
Jonathan Belcher, who was an evangelical supporter of Whiteﬁeld. The second
was with “a great number of negroes,” who requested a private session with him.
He preached to them on the conversion of the Ethiopian in Acts 8.
  Whiteﬁeld visited towns up the coast from Boston from September 29 to
October 6, ﬁnding some successes but also a great deal of passivity. Maine and
New Hampshire had a substantial revival tradition, having seen large numbers
of conversions and admissions to full communion in the 1727–28 earthquake




mad50316_issue05_097-122.indd 104                                                         25/01/12 6:45 PM

 awakening, and to a lesser extent in 1735–36 as a devastating “throat distem-
 per” (diphtheria) raged there. He preached as far north as York, Maine, at the
 church of the well-respected Samuel Moody. His northern tour gave Nicholas
 Gilman of Exeter, who had been reading Whiteﬁeld’s Journals and sermons for
 almost a year, a chance to meet him. Gilman was perhaps not as adulatory in
 his initial response to Whiteﬁeld as one might expect, noting that “there are
 Various Conjectures about Mr. Whiteﬁeld,” but expressing hope that he truly
 was “a Man of an Excellent Spirit.” Whiteﬁeld’s appearance precipitated a con-
 version crisis for Gilman, as well, and set him on the path to becoming one
 of the most radical of New England’s evangelicals. Whiteﬁeld won some nota-
 ble converts in Maine, especially John Rogers. The pastor at Kittery, Rogers
 had been in the ministry for thirty years when he heard Whiteﬁeld, but he
 had never experienced conversion. Whiteﬁeld’s ministry convinced him of
 his need for the new birth, and afterwards he became one of Whiteﬁeld’s
 foremost proponents in Maine. Rogers’s son Daniel, a tutor at Harvard, would
 soon join Whiteﬁeld’s entourage and seek his own assurance of salvation. The
 revivals in Maine and New Hampshire would not begin in force until late
 1741, however.
       Returning to Boston, Whiteﬁeld continued seeing large audiences, but
 he also gravitated toward Tennent’s confrontational style as he spoke against
 unconverted ministers. “I am persuaded,” he wrote in his journal, “[that] the
 generality of preachers talk of an unknown and unfelt Christ.” He felt ener-
 gized by confronting the unsaved clergy: “Unspeakable freedom God gave
 me while treating on this head.” Although some of the ministers may have
 grown uneasy at such talk, Whiteﬁeld drew ever-larger crowds, until he ﬁnally
 announced a farewell sermon on October 12, which drew a crowd estimated
 at twenty thousand. If reasonably accurate, this was the largest crowd ever
 assembled in America up to that time.
       From Boston, Whiteﬁeld traveled west through New England. Delivering
 on his promise, Whiteﬁeld went slightly out of his way to visit Northampton.
 It was a poignant occasion for Edwards, who had waited ﬁve long years
 for revival ﬁre to reignite in Northampton. Edwards shed tears during
 Whiteﬁeld’s preaching. Whiteﬁeld, too, was deeply affected by his visit and
 impressed with Edwards’s wife and children, who seemed to him models
 of piety and propriety. Whiteﬁeld’s preaching in Northampton reached a
 crescendo on the Sabbath, as “Mr. Edwards wept during the whole time of
 exercise” in the morning. “Mr. Whiteﬁeld’s sermons were suitable to the cir-
 cumstances of the town,” Edwards wrote later to Thomas Prince, “contain-
 ing just reproofs of our back-slidings.” He reported to Whiteﬁeld that the
 revival bore lasting fruit, including the conversion of some of the Edwardses’
 children. Immediately after Whiteﬁeld’s departure, however, Edwards did
 begin a sermon series on the parable of the sower (Matthew 13), including
 warnings that short-lived episodes of heated preaching and crying did not
 make for saving religion. He subtly warned that Whiteﬁeld’s brand of reviv-
 alism was ripe for religious hypocrisy. Edwards would continue to support
 Whiteﬁeld, but he insisted that Northampton would experience revival on
 his terms.

   Accompanied by Edwards, Whiteﬁeld made his way south to East Windsor,
the home of Edwards’s parents. Along the way Whiteﬁeld kept preaching on
unconverted ministers, and at one point Edwards cautioned Whiteﬁeld about
not judging other ministers too harshly or trying to ascertain whether they
were converted. Edwards supported Whiteﬁeld overall, but he certainly had
doubts about the emotionalism and rash judgments that seemed to character-
ize the itinerant’s ministry. In East Windsor, Whiteﬁeld preached to Timothy
Edwards’s congregation and then visited the elderly pastor and his wife Esther
Stoddard Edwards, sharing supper and staying the night in their home.
   Out of Whiteﬁeld’s journey through Connecticut came two remarkable
testimonies of conversion. The ﬁrst was from the East Windsor saddler Samuel
Belcher. Though Belcher grew up in the family of Joseph Belcher, pastor at Ded-
ham, Massachusetts, he became “Cold and Dull” in matters of salvation, and
though he experienced some concerns for his soul before 1740, they had not
lasted. Whiteﬁeld’s arrival signaled the beginning of a six-month-long conversion
crisis. When “mr Whiteﬁeld p[re]ached here, . . . I was Greatly effected with his
preaching both here and att Hartford,” Belcher wrote. Belcher grew cold again,
but then in April he met a man in Lebanon, Connecticut, who told of the revival
there, which deeply impressed him. Then pastors Eleazar Wheelock of Lebanon
and Benjamin Pomeroy of Hebron preached at East Windsor, and Belcher fell
under deeper convictions than ever before. He felt the terrors of sin and the
threat of damnation, “but God was pleased to enable me to Cry mightily unto
him in the bitterness of my Soul for mercy in and through Jesus Christ.” While
he was praying, “I felt my Load Go of and my mouth was Stopt and I Could not
utter one word for Some time and I felt as if my heart was Changed.” When
Belcher could speak again, he began praising God and he knew he had been
saved. For Belcher, Whiteﬁeld’s exhortations began the conversion process, but
Wheelock’s and Pomeroy’s preaching, and his own prayers, ﬁnished the ordeal.
   Whiteﬁeld’s appearance also represented a beginning point for the conver-
sion of Nathan Cole, a farmer and carpenter from Kensington, Connecticut.
Cole grew up as what he called an “Arminian,” likely meaning that he casually
assumed that good works would save him. He began to hear reports about White-
ﬁeld’s tour, and he “longed to see and hear him, and wished he would come this
way.” News arrived in October that Whiteﬁeld had left Boston for Northampton.
Then on October 23, a messenger arrived and told him that Whiteﬁeld was com-
ing to nearby Middletown later that morning. Cole ran in from the ﬁeld to tell
his wife that they were leaving immediately, fearing they would not have time to
get there. As they neared the road to Middletown, he wrote that


   I saw before me a Cloud or fogg rising; I ﬁrst thought it came from the
   great River, but as I came nearer the Road, I heard a noise something like a
   low rumbling thunder and presently found it was the noise of Horses feet
   coming down the Road and this Cloud was a Cloud of dust. . . . I could
   see men and horses Sliping along in the Cloud like shadows . . . every
   horse seemed to go with all his might to carry his rider to hear news from
   heaven for the saving of Souls, it made me tremble to see the Sight, how
   the world was in a Struggle.

 When they arrived at the Middletown meeting house, Cole guessed that per-
 haps three or four thousand had assembled there, the countryside having
 emptied of its residents. Then Whiteﬁeld came to the scaffold:

        He Looked almost angelical; a young, Slim, slender, youth before some
        thousands of people with a bold undaunted Countenance . . . he looked
        as if he was Cloathed with authority from the Great God. . . . And my
        hearing him preach, gave me a heart wound; By Gods blessing: my old
        Foundation was broken up, and I saw that my righteousness would not
        save me; then I was convinced of the doctrine of Election: and went
        right to quarrelling with God about it; because that all I could do would
        not save me; and he had decreed from Eternity who should be saved
        and who not.

       Cole’s “quarrelling” with God lasted almost two years. Like Jonathan
 Edwards, he wrestled with the doctrine of predestination, thinking it abhor-
 rent, while at the same time wondering if he himself was damned. “Hell ﬁre
 was most always in my mind; and I have hundreds of times put my ﬁngers into
 my pipe when I have been smoaking to feel how ﬁre felt.” In the midst of his
 fears of hell’s torments, however, God gave him a vision:

        God appeared unto me and made me Skringe: before whose face the
        heavens and the earth ﬂed away; and I was Shrinked into nothing; I
        knew not whether I was in the body or out, I seemed to hang in open Air
        before God, and he seemed to Speak to me in an angry and Sovereign
        way what won’t you trust your Soul with God; My heart answered O yes,
        yes, yes. . . . Now while my Soul was viewing God, my ﬂeshly part was
        working imaginations and saw many things which I will omitt to tell
        at this time. . . . When God appeared to me every thing vanished and
        was gone in the twinkling of an Eye, as quick as A ﬂash of lightning; But
        when God disappeared or in some measure withdrew, every thing was
        in its place again and I was on my Bed. My heart was broken; my burden
        was fallen of[f] my mind; I was set free, my distress was gone.


 Cole’s long conversion culminated, as it did for many early evangelicals, with
 a vision of God.
       In New Haven, Whiteﬁeld visited with Rector Thomas Clap, who would
 later become one of his most bitter opponents. For now, Whiteﬁeld received a
 universally polite, if not entirely zealous, reception at Yale, despite his speak-
 ing to the students about “the dreadful ill consequences of an unconverted
 ministry.” Whiteﬁeld then continued toward New York, and when he reached
 the border, he evaluated New England as impressive because of its godly herit-
 age, but he feared that “Many, nay most that preach . . . do not experimen-
 tally know Christ.” He loved the excitement his visit generated, though, and
 he thought New England was pliable enough for true revival. Pastor William
 Gaylord of Wilton, Connecticut, brother-in-law of James Davenport, wrote
 that many thought Whiteﬁeld “has a Touch of Enthusiasm” but that over-
 heatedness could be forgiven more easily than lukewarmness. He believed

Whiteﬁeld’s most profound effect might have been “stirring up” the ministers
themselves, though he did have reservations about Whiteﬁeld’s comments on
unconverted ministers. Much of the power of Whiteﬁeld’s tours lay in his abil-
ity to excite the local ministers to more fervent gospel preaching.
  As Whiteﬁeld’s band crossed into New York, the Harvard tutor Daniel
Rogers came to the spiritual awakening he had sought during weeks of travel.
After a meeting at King’s Bridge (now a part of the Bronx), Rogers wrote,
“It pleased God of his free Sovreign Grace to come into my poor Soul with
Power and so to ﬁll me with Peace: yea with Such Joy in the Holy Ghost as
I never Experienced before—I cd not forbear Smiling nay Laughing for Joy
and Gladness of Heart.” Rogers shared the news with an elated Whiteﬁeld, but
soon after Satan was tormenting Rogers with “Abominable Horrible Shocking
Tho’ts.” Assurance was not always easily gained by the new evangelicals. . . .
  Whiteﬁeld continued to preach with considerable success in New York
City, then moved on to Staten Island where he rendezvoused with Gilbert
Tennent and John Cross. Tennent told him of his recent itineration through
south Jersey, Delaware, and northern Maryland, while Cross reported that he
had recently “seen great and wonderful things in his congregations.” They
arrived at Cross’s Basking Ridge congregation on November 5, where James
Davenport had been preaching in the morning. At an affecting afternoon serv-
ice, Daniel Rogers recalled that a nine- or ten-year-old boy began speaking
loudly, at which time Whiteﬁeld called on the crowd “to hear this Lad preach-
ing to them.” This led to a “General motion” during which many cried out,
some fainted, and some fell into ﬁts. A young man near Rogers was so moved
that he had to lean on Rogers during much of the sermon until he ﬁnally fell
to his knees.
  The large crowd then retired to Cross’s barn for the evening lecture. Ten-
nent preached ﬁrst, followed by Whiteﬁeld. Whiteﬁeld estimated that he had
spoken for six minutes when one man began to shout, “He is come, He is
come!” (Rogers recalled the man as crying “I have found him!”) Many oth-
ers began crying out “for the like favour,” and Whiteﬁeld stopped to pray
over them, which only heightened their fervent emotions. Rogers struggled to
adequately describe the meeting, but noted that many were “weeping, Sigh-
ing, Groaning, Sobbing, screaching, crying out.” The ministers ﬁnally retired,
but Rogers and Davenport returned at one o’clock in the morning to resume
preaching. Many in the congregation stayed up all night in the barn, praying
and worshipping. “Tis a night to be remembered,” Rogers wrote.
  The next morning many penitents approached the departing Whiteﬁeld,
including a “poor negro woman,” a slave, who asked to join his entourage.
Her master actually agreed to this idea (it is unlikely that he had permanent
emancipation in mind), but Whiteﬁeld told her to go home and “serve her
present master.” Whiteﬁeld and most white evangelicals were unprepared to
let the social implications of his gospel run a course to abolitionism. . . .
  . . . Whiteﬁeld’s tour moved on to New Brunswick, where Whiteﬁeld
began telling Gilbert Tennent and Daniel Rogers to go to New England to
follow up on the work there. Tennent initially refused, but after encourage-
ment from Whiteﬁeld and an apparent vote by the entourage, Tennent agreed.

 Whiteﬁeld headed south with Davenport while Rogers and Tennent began
 planning their new tours. In Philadelphia, Whiteﬁeld began preaching in the
 so-called New Building, a structure erected by supporters speciﬁcally for his
 visits. The one-hundred-by-seventy-foot building became Whiteﬁeld’s usual
 pulpit in Philadelphia, and though the fervor of his earlier visit had abated,
 wondrous visitations continued. At one meeting, many reported experiencing
 the sensation of being pierced by “pointed arrows” as he preached, and a
 young woman fell down senseless during the meeting and had to be carried
 home. On another occasion Whiteﬁeld reported that he spontaneously spoke
 against “reasoning unbelievers,” and he later found out that “a number of
 them were present” at his sermon. He attributed his well-timed admonition to
 the leading of the Holy Ghost.
        Through November, Whiteﬁeld continued his tour of southern New
 Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, making stops at friendly
 congregations in Whiteclay Creek, Fagg’s Manor, Nottingham, and Bohemia
 Manor. Whiteﬁeld, as was often the case, fell terribly ill at Fagg’s Manor, writ-
 ing that “straining caused me to vomit much.” But he continued preaching
 and praying, and “soon every person in the room seemed to be under great
 impressions, sighing and weeping.” On December 1, Whiteﬁeld departed for
 South Carolina and Georgia, noting with satisfaction that he had preached
 perhaps one hundred seventy-ﬁve times since he arrived in Rhode Island two-
 and-a-half months earlier. The presence of God that attended his meetings
 convinced him that the British American provinces would remain his “chief
 scene for action.” The fall 1740 tour had been a gigantic success for Whiteﬁeld.
 His method of theatrical ﬁeld preaching rejuvenated New England’s substan-
 tial revival tradition and captivated tens of thousands of listeners. His incau-
 tious remarks about unconverted ministers, however, and his friendship with
 such ﬁgures as Tennent, Davenport, and Cross laid the groundwork for great
 controversies concerning the awakenings in the years ahead.

Enthusiasm Described and Decried:
  The Great Awakening
as Interpretative Fiction

I  n the last half century, the Great Awakening has assumed a major role in
explaining the political and social evolution of prerevolutionary American
society. Historians have argued, variously, that the Awakening severed intellec-
tual and philosophical connections between America and Europe (Perry
Miller), that it was a major vehicle of early lower-class protest ( John C. Miller,
Rhys Isaac, and Gary B. Nash), that it was a means by which New England
Puritans became Yankees (Richard L. Bushman), that it was the ﬁrst “intercolo-
nial movement” to stir “the people of several colonies on a matter of common
emotional concern” (Richard Hofstadter following William Warren Sweet), or
that it involved “a rebirth of the localistic impulse” (Kenneth Lockridge).
  American historians also have increasingly linked the Awakening directly
to the Revolution. Alan Heimert has tagged it as the source of a Calvinist polit-
ical ideology that irretrievably shaped eighteenth-century American society
and the Revolution it produced. Harry S. Stout has argued that the Awakening
stimulated a new system of mass communications that increased the colonists’
political awareness and reduced their deference to elite groups prior to the
Revolution. Isaac and Nash have described the Awakening as the source of a
simpler, non-Calvinist protest rhetoric that reinforced revolutionary ideology
in disparate places, among them Virginia and the northern port cities. William
G. McLoughlin has even claimed that the Great Awakening was nothing less
than “the Key to the American Revolution.”
  These claims for the signiﬁcance of the Great Awakening come from more
than specialists in the colonial period. They are a ubiquitous feature of American
history survey texts, where the increased emphasis on social history has made
these claims especially useful in interpreting early American society to twentieth
-century students. Virtually all texts treat the Great Awakening as a major
watershed in the maturation of prerevolutionary American society. The Great
Republic terms the Awakening “the greatest event in the history of religion in
eighteenth-century America.” The National Experience argues that the Awakening
brought “religious experiences to thousands of people in every rank of society”
and in every region. The Essentials of American History stresses how the Awakening
“aroused a spirit of humanitarianism,” “encouraged the notion of equal rights,”

 and “stimulated feelings of democracy” even if its gains in church membership
 proved episodic. These texts and others describe the weakened position of the
 clergy produced by the Awakening as symptomatic of growing disrespect for all
 forms of authority in the colonies and as an important catalyst, even cause, of the
 American Revolution. The effect of these claims is astonishing. Buttressed by the
 standard lecture on the Awakening tucked into most survey courses, American
 undergraduates have been well trained to remember the Great Awakening because
 their instructors and texts have invested it with such signiﬁcance.
        Does the Great Awakening warrant such enthusiasm? Its puzzling histori-
 ography suggests one caution. The Awakening has received surprisingly lit-
 tle systematic study and lacks even one comprehensive general history. The
 two studies, by Heimert and Cedric B. Cowing, that might qualify as general
 histories actually are deeply centered in New England. They venture into the
 middle and southern colonies only occasionally and concentrate on intellec-
 tual themes to the exclusion of social history. The remaining studies are thor-
 oughly regional, as in the case of books by Bushman, Edwin Scott Gaustad,
 Charles Hartshorn Maxson, Dietmar Rothermund, and Wesley M. Gewehr, or
 are local, as with the spate of articles on New England towns and Jonathan
 Edwards’s or Isaac’s articles and book on Virginia. The result is that the general
 character of the Great Awakening lacks sustained, comprehensive study even
 while it beneﬁts from thorough local examinations. The relationship between
 the Revolution and the Awakening is described in an equally peculiar manner.
 Heimert’s seminal 1966 study, despite fair and unfair criticism, has become
 that kind of inﬂuential work whose awesome reputation apparently discour-
 ages further pursuit of its subject. Instead, historians frequently allude to the
 positive relationship between the Awakening and the Revolution without
 probing the matter in a fresh, systematic way.
        The gap between the enthusiasm of historians for the social and political
 signiﬁcance of the Great Awakening and its slim, peculiar historiography raises
 two important issues. First, contemporaries never homogenized the eighteenth-
 century colonial religious revivals by labeling them “the Great Awakening.”
 Although such words appear in Edwards’s Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work
 of God, Edwards used them alternately with other phrases, such as “general
 awakening,” “great alteration,” and “ﬂourishing of religion,” only to describe
 the Northampton revivals of 1734–1735. He never capitalized them or gave
 them other special emphasis and never used the phrase “the Great Awakening”
 to evaluate all the prerevolutionary revivals. Rather, the ﬁrst person to do so
 was the nineteenth-century historian and antiquarian Joseph Tracy, who used
 Edwards’s otherwise unexceptional words as the title of his famous 1842 book,
 The Great Awakening. Tellingly, however, Tracy’s creation did not ﬁnd immedi-
 ate favor among American historians. Charles Hodge discussed the Presbyterian
 revivals in his Constitutional History of the Presbyterian Church without describing
 them as part of a “Great Awakening,” while the inﬂuential Robert Baird refused
 even to treat the eighteenth-century revivals as discrete and important events,
 much less label them “the Great Awakening.” Baird all but ignored these reviv-
 als in the chronological segments of his Religion in America and mentioned them
 elsewhere only by way of explaining the intellectual origins of the Unitarian




mad50316_issue05_097-122.indd 111                                                           25/01/12 6:45 PM

movement, whose early leaders opposed revivals. Thus, not until the last half of
the nineteenth century did “the Great Awakening” become a familiar feature of
the American historical landscape.
   Second, this particular label ought to be viewed with suspicion, not
because a historian created it—historians legitimately make sense of the minu-
tiae of the past by utilizing such devices—but because the label itself does
serious injustice to the minutiae it orders. The label “the Great Awakening”
distorts the extent, nature, and cohesion of the revivals that did exist in the
eighteenth-century colonies, encourages unwarranted claims for their effects
on colonial society, and exaggerates their inﬂuence on the coming and char-
acter of the American Revolution. If “the Great Awakening” is not quite an
American Donation of Constantine, its appeal to historians seeking to explain
the shaping and character of prerevolutionary American society gives it a
political and intellectual power whose very subtlety requires a close inspection
of its claims to truth.
   How do historians describe “the Great Awakening”? Three points seem
especially common. First, all but a few describe it as a Calvinist religious revival
in which converts acknowledged their sinfulness without expecting salvation.
These colonial converts thereby distinguished themselves from Englishmen
caught up in contemporary Methodist revivals and from Americans involved
in the so-called Second Great Awakening of the early national period, both
of which imbibed Arminian principles that allowed humans to believe they
might effect their own salvation in ways that John Calvin discounted. Sec-
ond, historians emphasize the breadth and suddenness of the Awakening
and frequently employ hurricane metaphors to reinforce the point. Thus,
many of them describe how in the 1740s the Awakening “swept” across the
mainland colonies, leaving only England’s Caribbean colonies untouched.
Third, most historians argue that this spiritual hurricane affected all facets of
prerevolutionary society. Here they adopt Edwards’s description of the 1736
Northampton revival as one that touched “all sorts, sober and vicious, high
and low, rich and poor, wise and unwise,” but apply it to all the colonies.
Indeed, some historians go farther and view the Great Awakening as a verita-
ble social and political revolution itself. Writing in the late 1960s, Bushman
could only wonder at its power: “We inevitably will underestimate the effect
of the Awakening on eighteenth-century society if we compare it to reviv-
als today. The Awakening was more like the civil rights demonstrations, the
campus disturbances, and the urban riots of the 1960s combined. All together
these may approach, though certainly not surpass, the Awakening in their
impact on national life.”
   No one would seriously question the existence of “the Great Awaken-
ing” if historians only described it as a short-lived Calvinist revival in New
England during the early 1740s. Whether stimulated by Edwards, James Dav-
enport, or the British itinerant George Whiteﬁeld, the New England revivals
between 1740 and 1745 obviously were Calvinist ones. Their sponsors vig-
orously criticized the soft-core Arminianism that had reputedly overtaken
New England Congregationalism, and they stimulated the ritual renewal of a
century-old society by reintroducing colonists to the theology of distinguished




mad50316_issue05_097-122.indd 112                                                          25/01/12 6:45 PM

 seventeenth-century Puritan clergymen, especially Thomas Shepard and Solo-
 mon Stoddard.
       Yet, Calvinism never dominated the eighteenth-century religious revivals
 homogenized under the label “the Great Awakening.” The revivals in the mid-
 dle colonies ﬂowed from especially disparate and international sources. John B.
 Frantz’s recent traversal of the German revivals there demonstrates that they
 took root in Lutheranism, German Reformed Calvinism (different from the New
 England variety), and Pietism (however one wants to deﬁne it). Maxson stressed
 the mysticism, Pietism, Rosicrucianism, and Freemasonry rampant in these colo-
 nies among both German and English settlers. In an often overlooked observa-
 tion, Maxson noted that the Tennents’ backing for revivals was deeply linked to
 a mystical experience surrounding the near death of John Tennent and that both
 John Tennent and William Tennent, Jr., were mystics as well as Calvinists. The
 revivals among English colonists in Virginia also reveal eclectic roots. Presbyte-
 rians brought Calvinism into the colony for the ﬁrst time since the 1650s, but
 Arminianism underwrote the powerful Methodist awakening in the colony and
 soon crept into the ranks of the colony’s Baptists as well.
       “The Great Awakening” also is difﬁcult to date. Seldom has an “event”
 of such magnitude had such amorphous beginnings and endings. In New
 England, historians agree, the revivals ﬂourished principally between 1740
 and 1743 and had largely ended by 1745, although a few scattered outbreaks
 of revivalism occurred there in the next decades. Establishing the beginning of
 the revivals has proved more difﬁcult, however. Most historians settle for the
 year 1740 because it marks Whiteﬁeld’s ﬁrst appearance in New England. But
 everyone acknowledges that earlier revivals underwrote Whiteﬁeld’s enthusi-
 astic reception there and involved remarkable numbers of colonists. Edwards
 counted thirty-two towns caught up in revivals in 1734–1735 and noted that
 his own grandfather, Stoddard, had conducted no less than ﬁve “harvests” in
 Northampton before that, the earliest in the 1690s. Yet revivals in Virginia, the
 site of the most sustained such events in the southern colonies, did not emerge
 in signiﬁcant numbers until the 1750s and did not peak until the 1760s. At
 the same time, they also continued into the revolutionary and early national
 periods in ways that make them difﬁcult to separate from their predecessors.
       Yet even if one were to argue that “the Great Awakening” persisted through
 most of the eighteenth century, it is obvious that revivals “swept” only some
 of the mainland colonies. They occurred in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode
 Island, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Virginia with some frequency at least
 at some points between 1740 and 1770. But New Hampshire, Maryland, and
 Georgia witnessed few revivals in the same years, and revivals were only occa-
 sionally important in New York, Delaware, North Carolina, and South Carolina.
 The revivals also touched only certain segments of the population in the colonies
 where they occurred. The best example of the phenomenon is Pennsylvania. The
 revivals there had a sustained effect among English settlers only in Presbyterian
 churches where many of the laity and clergy also opposed them. The Baptists,
 who were so important to the New England revivals, paid little attention to them
 until the 1760s, and the colony’s taciturn Quakers watched them in perplexed
 silence. Not even Germans imbibed them universally. At the same time that

Benjamin Franklin was emptying his pockets in response to the preaching
of Whiteﬁeld in Philadelphia—or at least claiming to do so—the residents of
Germantown were steadily leaving their churches, and Stephanie Grauman
Wolf reports that they remained steadfast in their indifference to Christianity
at least until the 1780s.
  Whiteﬁeld’s revivals also exchanged notoriety for substance. Colonists
responded to him as a charismatic performer, and he actually fell victim to
the Billy Graham syndrome of modern times: his visits, however exciting, pro-
duced few permanent changes in local religious patterns. For example, his
appearances in Charleston led to his well-known confrontation with Anglican
Commissary Alexander Garden and to the suicide two years later of a distraught
follower named Anne LeBrasseur. Yet they produced no new congregations in
Charleston and had no documented effect on the general patterns of religious
adherence elsewhere in the colony. The same was true in Philadelphia and
New York City despite the fact that Whiteﬁeld preached to enormous crowds
in both places. Only Bostonians responded differently. Supporters organized
in the late 1740s a new “awakened” congregation that reputedly met with con-
siderable initial success, and opponents adopted a defensive posture exempli-
ﬁed in the writings of Charles Chauncy that profoundly affected New England
intellectual life for two decades.
  Historians also exaggerate the cohesion of leadership in the revivals. They
have accomplished this, in part, by overstressing the importance of Whiteﬁeld
and Edwards. Whiteﬁeld’s early charismatic inﬂuence later faded so that his
appearances in the 1750s and 1760s had less impact even among evangelicals
than they had in the 1740s. In addition, Whiteﬁeld’s “leadership” was ethe-
real, at best, even before 1750. His principal early importance was to serve as
a personal model of evangelical enterprise for ministers wishing to promote
their own revivals of religion. Because he did little to organize and coordinate
integrated colonial revivals, he also failed to exercise signiﬁcant authority over
the ministers he inspired.
  The case against Edwards’s leadership of the revivals is even clearer. Edwards
defended the New England revivals from attack. But, like Whiteﬁeld, he never
organized and coordinated revivals throughout the colonies or even throughout
New England. Since most of his major works were not printed in his lifetime,
even his intellectual leadership in American theology occurred in the century
after his death. Whiteﬁeld’s lack of knowledge about Edwards on his ﬁrst tour of
America in 1739–1740 is especially telling on this point. Edwards’s name does not
appear in Whiteﬁeld’s journal prior to the latter’s visit to Northampton in 1740,
and Whiteﬁeld did not make the visit until Edwards had invited him to do so.
Whiteﬁeld certainly knew of Edwards and the 1734–1735 Northampton revival
but associated the town mainly with the pastorate of Edwards’s grandfather Stod-
dard. As Whiteﬁeld described the visit in his journal: “After a little refreshment,
we crossed the ferry to Northampton, where no less than three hundred souls
were saved about ﬁve years ago. Their pastor’s name is Edwards, successor and
grandson to the great Stoddard, whose memory will be always precious to my
soul, and whose books entitled ‘A Guide to Christ,’ and ‘Safety of Appearing in
Christ’s Righteousness,’ I would recommend to all.”

       What were the effects of the prerevolutionary revivals of religion? The
 claims for their religious and secular impact need pruning too. One area of
 concern involves the relationship between the revivals and the rise of the
 Dissenting denominations in the colonies. Denomination building was inti-
 mately linked to the revivals in New England. There, as C. C. Goen has dem-
 onstrated, the revivals of the 1740s stimulated formation of over two hundred
 new congregations and several new denominations. This was accomplished
 mainly through a negative process called “Separatism,” which split existing
 Congregationalist and Baptist churches along prorevival and antirevival lines.
 But Separatism was of no special consequence in increasing the number of
 Dissenters farther south. Presbyterians, Baptists, and, later, Methodists gained
 strength from former Anglicans who left their state-supported churches, but
 they won far more recruits among colonists who claimed no previous congre-
 gational membership.
       Still, two points are important in assessing the importance of revivals to
 the expansion of the Dissenting denominations in the colonies. First, revival-
 ism never was the key to the expansion of the colonial churches. Presbyteri-
 anism expanded as rapidly in the middle colonies between 1710 and 1740 as
 between 1740 and 1770. Revivalism scarcely produced the remarkable growth
 that the Church of England experienced in the eighteenth century unless, of
 course, it won the favor of colonists who opposed revivals as ﬁercely as did its
 leaders. Gaustad estimates that between 1700 and 1780 Anglican congrega-
 tions expanded from about one hundred to four hundred, and Bruce E. Steiner
 has outlined extraordinary Anglican growth in the Dissenting colony of Con-
 necticut although most historians describe the colony as being thoroughly
 absorbed by the revivals and “Separatism.”
       Second, the expansion of the leading evangelical denominations,
 Presbyterians and Baptists, can be traced to many causes, not just revivalism or
 “the Great Awakening.” The growth of the colonial population from fewer than
 three hundred thousand in 1700 to over two million in 1770 made the expansion
 of even the most modestly active denominations highly likely. This was especially
 true because so many new colonists did not settle in established communities but
 in new communities that lacked religious institutions. As Timothy L. Smith has
 written of seventeenth-century settlements, the new eighteenth-century settle-
 ments welcomed congregations as much for the social functions they performed
 as for their religious functions. Some of the denominations reaped the legacy of
 Old World religious ties among new colonists, and others beneﬁted from local
 anti-Anglican sentiment, especially in the Virginia and Carolina backcountry. As
 a result, evangelical organizers formed many congregations in the middle and
 southern colonies without resorting to revivals at all. The ﬁrst Presbyterian con-
 gregation in Hanover County, Virginia, organized by Samuel Blair and William
 Tennent, Jr., in 1746, rested on an indigenous lay critique of Anglican theology
 that had turned residents to the works of Martin Luther, and after the campaign
 by Blair and Tennent, the congregation allied itself with the Presbyterian denom-
 ination rather than with simple revivalism.
       The revivals democratized relations between ministers and the laity only
 in minimal ways. A signiﬁcant number of New England ministers changed their




mad50316_issue05_097-122.indd 115                                                         25/01/12 6:45 PM

preaching styles as a result of the 1740 revivals. Heimert quotes Isaac Backus on
the willingness of evangelicals to use sermons to “’insinuate themselves into
the affections’ of the people” and notes how opponents of the revivals like
Chauncy nonetheless struggled to incorporate emotion and “sentiment” into
their sermons after 1740. Yet revivalists and evangelicals continued to draw sharp
distinctions between the rights of ministers and the duties of the laity. Edwards
did so in a careful, sophisticated way in Some Thoughts concerning the Present
Revival of Religion in New England. Although he noted that “disputing, jangling,
and contention” surrounded “lay exhorting,” he agreed that “some exhorting is
a Christian duty.” But he quickly moved to a strong defense of ministerial pre-
rogatives, which he introduced with the proposition that “the Common people
in exhorting one another ought not to clothe themselves with the like authority,
with that which is proper for ministers.” Gilbert Tennent was less cautious. In his
1740 sermon The Danger of an Unconverted Ministry, he bitterly attacked “Pharisee-
shepherds” and “Pharisee-teachers” whose preaching was frequently as “unedify-
ing” as their personal lives. But Gilbert Tennent never attacked the ministry itself.
Rather, he argued for the necessity of a converted ministry precisely because he
believed that only preaching brought men and women to Christ and that only
ordained ministers could preach. Thus, in both 1742 and 1757, he thundered
against lay preachers. They were “of dreadful consequence to the Church’s peace
and soundness in principle. . . . [F]or Ignorant Young Converts to take upon them
authoritatively to Instruct and Exhort publickly tends to introduce the greatest
Errors and the greatest anarchy and confusion.”
   The 1740 revival among Presbyterians in New Londonderry, Pennsylvania,
demonstrates well how ministers shepherded the laity into a revival and how the
laity followed rather than led. It was Blair, the congregation’s minister, who ﬁrst
criticized “dead Formality in Religion” and brought the congregation’s members
under “deep convictions” of their “natural unregenerate state.” Blair stimulated
“soul exercises” in the laity that included crying and shaking, but he also set
limits for these exercises. He exhorted them to “moderate and bound their pas-
sions” so that the revival would not be destroyed by its own methods. Above
this din, Blair remained a commanding, judgmental ﬁgure who stimulated the
laity’s hopes for salvation but remained “very cautious of expressing to People
my Judgment of the Goodness of their States, excepting where I had pretty clear
Evidences from them, of their being savingly changed.” . . .
   Nor did the revivals change the structure of authority within the denom-
inations. New England Congregationalists retained the right of individual con-
gregations to ﬁre ministers, as when Northampton dismissed Edwards in 1750.
But in both the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, these congregations
seldom acted alone. Instead, they nearly always consulted extensively with
committees of ordained ministers when ﬁring as well as when hiring minis-
ters. In the middle colonies, however, neither the prorevival Synod of New
York nor the antirevival Synod of Philadelphia tolerated such independence
in congregations whether in theory or in practice. In both synods, unhappy
congregations had to convince special committees appointed by the synods
and composed exclusively of ministers that the performance of a fellow cleric
was sufﬁciently dismal to warrant his dismissal. Congregations that acted

 independently in such matters quickly found themselves censured, and they
 usually lost the aid of both synods in ﬁnding and installing new ministers.
        Did the revivals stir lower-class discontent, increase participation in poli-
 tics, and promote democracy in society generally if not in the congregations?
 Even in New England the answer is, at best, equivocal. Historians have laid to
 rest John C. Miller’s powerfully stated argument of the 1930s that the revivals
 were, in good part, lower-class protests against dominant town elites. The reviv-
 als indeed complicated local politics because they introduced new sources of
 potential and real conﬂict into the towns. New England towns accustomed to
 containing tensions inside a single congregation before 1730 sometimes had to
 deal with tensions within and between as many as three or four congregations
 after 1730. Of course, not all of these religious groups were produced by the
 revivals, and, as Michael Zuckerman has pointed out, some towns never tolerated
 the new dissidents and used the “warning out” system to eject them. Still, even
 where it existed, tumult should not be confused with democracy. Social class,
 education, and wealth remained as important after 1730 in choosing town and
 church ofﬁcers as they had been before 1730, and Edward M. Cook, Jr., notes that
 after 1730 most new revival congregations blended into the old order: “dissenters
 [took] their place in town affairs once they stopped threatening the community
 and symbolically became loyal members of it.” . . .
        What, then, ought we to say about the revivals of religion in prerevolu-
 tionary America? The most important suggestion is the most drastic. Histori-
 ans should abandon the term “the Great Awakening” because it distorts the
 character of eighteenth-century American religious life and misinterprets its
 relationship to prerevolutionary American society and politics. In religion it
 is a deus ex machina that falsely homogenizes the heterogeneous; in politics
 it falsely unites the colonies in slick preparation for the Revolution. Instead, a
 four-part model of the eighteenth-century colonial revivals will highlight their
 common features, underscore important differences, and help us assess their
 real signiﬁcance.
        First, with one exception, the prerevolutionary revivals should be under-
 stood primarily as regional events that occurred in only half the colonies.
 Revivals occurred intermittently in New England between 1690 and 1745 but
 became especially common between 1735 and 1745. They were uniformly
 Calvinist and produced more signiﬁcant local political ramiﬁcations—even if
 they did not democratize New England—than other colonial revivals except
 those in Virginia. Revivals in the middle colonies occurred primarily between
 1740 and 1760. They had remarkably eclectic theological origins, bypassed
 large numbers of settlers, were especially weak in New York, and produced few
 demonstrable political and social changes. Revivals in the southern colonies
 did not occur in signiﬁcant numbers until the 1750s, when they were limited
 largely to Virginia, missed Maryland almost entirely, and did not occur with
 any regularity in the Carolinas until well after 1760. Virginia’s Baptist revival-
 ists stimulated major political and social changes in the colony, but the secular
 importance of the other revivals has been exaggerated. A fourth set of reviv-
 als, and the exception to the regional pattern outlined here, accompanied the
 preaching tours of the Anglican itinerant Whiteﬁeld. These tours frequently




mad50316_issue05_097-122.indd 117                                                           25/01/12 6:45 PM

intersected with the regional revivals in progress at different times in New
England, the middle colonies, and some parts of the southern colonies, but
even then the ﬁt was imperfect. Whiteﬁeld’s tours produced some changes
in ministerial speaking styles but few permanent alterations in institutional
patterns of religion, although his personal charisma supported no less than
seven tours of the colonies between 1740 and his death in Newburyport,
Massachusetts, in 1770.
  Second, the prerevolutionary revivals occurred in the colonial backwaters
of Western society where they were part of a long-term pattern of erratic move-
ments for spiritual renewal and revival that had long characterized Western
Christianity and Protestantism since its birth two centuries earlier. Thus,
their theological origins were international and diverse rather than narrowly
Calvinist and uniquely American. Calvinism was important in some revivals,
but Arminianism and Pietism supported others. This theological heterogeneity
also makes it impossible to isolate a single overwhelmingly important cause of
the revivals. Instead, they appear to have arisen when three circumstances were
present—internal demands for renewal in different international Christian
communities, charismatic preachers, and special, often unique, local circum-
stances that made communities receptive to elevated religious rhetoric.
  Third, the revivals had modest effects on colonial religion. This is not
to say that they were “conservative” because they did not always uphold the
traditional religious order. But they were never radical, whatever their crit-
ics claimed. For example, the revivals reinforced ministerial rather than lay
authority even as they altered some clergymen’s perceptions of their tasks
and methods. They also stimulated the demand for organization, order, and
authority in the evangelical denominations. Presbyterian “New Lights” repu-
diated the conservative Synod of Philadelphia because its discipline was too
weak, not too strong, and demanded tougher standards for ordination and
subsequent service. After 1760, when Presbyterians and Baptists utilized reviv-
alism as part of their campaigns for denominational expansion, they only
increased their stress on central denominational organization and authority.
  Indeed, the best test of the benign character of the revivals is to take up the
challenge of contemporaries who linked them to outbreaks of “enthusiasm” in
Europe. In making these charges, the two leading antirevivalists in the colonies,
Garden of Charleston and Chauncy of Boston, speciﬁcally compared the colonial
revivals with those of the infamous “French Prophets” of London, exiled Hugue-
nots who were active in the city between 1706 and about 1730. The French
Prophets predicted the downfall of English politicians, raised followers from the
dead, and used women extensively as leaders to prophesy and preach. By com-
parison, the American revivalists were indeed “conservative.” They prophesied
only about the millennium, not about local politicans, and described only the
necessity, not the certainty, of salvation. What is most important is that they
eschewed radical change in the position of women in the churches. True, women
experienced dramatic conversions, some of the earliest being described vividly
by Edwards. But, they preached only irregularly, rarely prophesied, and certainly
never led congregations, denominations, or sects in a way that could remotely
approach their status among the French Prophets.

                                                                  NO / Jon Butler       119

       Fourth, the link between the revivals and the American Revolution is
 virtually nonexistent. The relationship between prerevolutionary political
 change and the revivals is weak everywhere except in Virginia, where the
 Baptist revivals indeed shattered the exclusive, century-old Anglican hold on
 organized religious activity and politics in the colony. But, their importance
 to the Revolution is weakened by the fact that so many members of Virginia’s
 Anglican aristocracy also led the Revolution. In other colonies the revivals fur-
 nished little revolutionary rhetoric, including even millennialist thought, that
 was not available from other sources and provided no unique organizational
 mechanisms for anti-British protest activity. They may have been of some
 importance in helping colonists make moral judgments about eighteenth-
 century English politics, though colonists unconnected to the revivals made
 these judgments as well.
       In the main, then, the revivals of religion in eighteenth-century America
 emerge as nearly perfect mirrors of a regionalized, provincial society. They
 arose erratically in different times and places across a century from the 1690s
 down to the time of the Revolution. Calvinism underlay some of them, Pietism
 and Arminianism others. Their leadership was local and, at best, regional, and
 they helped reinforce—but were not the key to—the proliferation and expan-
 sion of still-regional Protestant denominations in the colonies. As such, they
 created no intercolonial religious institutions and fostered no signiﬁcant expe-
 riential unity in the colonies. Their social and political effects were minimal
 and usually local, although they could traumatize communities in which they
 upset, if only temporarily, familiar patterns of worship and social behavior.
 But the congregations they occasionally produced usually blended into the
 traditional social system, and the revivals abated without shattering its struc-
 ture. Thus, the revivals of religion in prerevolutionary America seldom became
 proto-revolutionary, and they failed to change the timing, causes, or effects of
 the Revolution in any signiﬁcant way.
       Of course, it is awkward to write about the eighteenth-century revivals of
 religion in America as erratic, heterogeneous, and politically benign. All of us
 have walked too long in the company of Tracy’s “Great Awakening” to make
 our journey into the colonial past without it anything but frightening. But as
 Chauncy wrote of the Whiteﬁeld revivals, perhaps now it is time for historians
 “to see that Things have been carried too far, and that the Hazard is great . . .
 lest we should be over-run with Enthusiasm.”

        EXPLORING THE ISSUE
       Was There a Great
  Awakening in Mid-Eighteenth-
       Century America?

Critical Thinking and Reﬂection
     1. What do historians mean by the term “Great Awakening”? Is there
        consensus among scholars regarding the signiﬁcance of the Great
        Awakening in early America? Explain.
     2. According to Thomas Kidd, what were the origins, goals, and conse-
        quences of the First Great Awakening?
     3. Who was George Whiteﬁeld, and what role did he play in mid-
        eighteenth-century religious revivals?
     4. What arguments does Jon Butler make in challenging the validity of
        an historical event known as the “Great Awakening”?
     5. Compare and contrast the conclusions reached by Kidd and Butler
        concerning the Great Awakening.
     6. Contrast the positions taken by Kidd and Butler concerning the
        inﬂuence of the Great Awakening on the American Revolution.


Is There Common Ground?
Few scholars are likely to be persuaded by Butler’s insistence upon abandon-
ing the label “Great Awakening” when referring to the colonial revivals of the
mid-eighteenth century, but some do ﬁnd merit in certain aspects of his inter-
pretation. In particular, Butler’s critique of efforts to link the Awakening with
the American Revolution is part of a longstanding historical debate related to
the intersection of religious and political liberty. Was there, in fact, a “Great
Awakening”? If so, how extensive was its inﬂuence? Is it possible to argue that
these religious revivals had little or no inﬂuence in some colonies or among
some religious denominations, or was it truly the ﬁrst shared national experi-
ence of the British North American colonies? What does the discussion of the
Great Awakening suggest about the more general understanding of religious
inﬂuences in the American colonies?
