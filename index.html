            Was There a Great

            Century America?

       


                                 ISSUE SUMMARY

        YES: Thomas Kidd insists that preachers such as George Whiteﬁeld
        engineered a powerful series of revivals in the mid-eighteenth cen-
        tury that inﬂuenced all of the British North American colonies and
        gave birth to a spirit of evangelicalism that initiated a major altera-
        tion of global Christian history.
        NO: Jon Butler claims that to describe the religious revival activities
        of the eighteenth century as the “Great Awakening” is to seriously
        exaggerate their extent, nature, and impact on prerevolutionary
        American society and politics.


   Although generations of American schoolchildren have been taught that
the British colonies in North America were founded by persons ﬂeeing reli-
gious persecution in England, the truth is that many of those early settlers
were motivated by other factors, some of which had little to do with theologi-
cal preferences. To be sure, the Pilgrims and Puritans of New England sought
to escape the proscriptions established by the Church of England. Many New
Englanders, however, did not adhere to the precepts of Calvinism and there-
fore were viewed as outsiders. The Quakers who populated Pennsylvania were
mostly fugitives from New England, where they had been victims of reli-
gious persecution. But to apply religious motivations to the earliest settlers of
Virginia, South Carolina, or Georgia is to engage in a serious misreading of the
historical record. Even in New England, the religious mission of Massachusetts
Bay Colony Governor John Winthrop’s “city upon a hill” began to erode as the
colonial settlements matured and stabilized.
   Although religion was a central element in the lives of the seventeenth-
and eighteenth-century Europeans who migrated to the New World, prolif-
eration of religious sects and denominations, emphasis upon material gain
in all parts of the colonies, and the predominance of reason over emotion
that is associated with the Deists of the Enlightenment period all contributed
to a gradual but obvious movement of the colonists away from the church
and clerical authority. William Bradford of Plymouth Colony, for example,
expressed grave concern that many Plymouth residents were following a path
of perﬁdy, and Pennsylvania founder William Penn was certain that the “holy
experiment” of the Quakers had failed. Colonial clergy, fearful that a fall from
grace was in progress, issued calls for a revival of religious fervor. The spirit of
revivalism that spread through the colonies in the 1730s and 1740s, therefore,
was an answer to these clerical prayers.
   The episode known as the First Great Awakening coincided with the Pie-
tistic movement in Europe and England and was carried forward by dynamic
preachers such as Gilbert Tennant, Theodore Frelinghuysen, and George
Whiteﬁeld. They promoted a religion of the heart, not of the head, in order
to produce a spiritual rebirth. These revivals, most historians agree, reinvigor-
ated American Protestantism. Many new congregations were organized as a
result of irremediable schisms between “Old Lights” and “New Lights.” Skep-
ticism about the desirability of an educated clergy sparked a strong strain of
anti-intellectualism. Also, the emphasis on conversion was a message to which
virtually everyone could respond, regardless of age, sex, race, or social status.
   For some historians, the implications of the Great Awakening extended
beyond the religious sphere into the realm of politics and were incorporated
into the American Revolution. William G. McLoughlin’s essay “‘Enthusiasm
for Liberty’: The Great Awakening as the Key to the Revolution,” in Jack P.
Greene and William G. McLoughlin, eds., Preachers & Politicians: Two Essays
on the Origins of the American Revolution (American Antiquarian Society, 1977)
claims that the Great Awakening paved the way for the American Revolution
by promoting religious revitalization, intercolonial unity, and democracy. In
his book Religion in America: Past and Present (Prentice-Hall, 1961), Clifton E.

                                    98



      Olmstead argues for a broader application of religious causes to the origins of
 the American Revolution. First, and consistent with McLoughlin and others,
 Olmstead contends that the Great Awakening did foster a sense of community
 among American colonists, thus providing the unity required for an organ-
 ized assault on English control. Moreover, the Awakening further weakened
 existing ties between colonies and Mother Country by drawing adherents of
 the Church of England into the evangelical denominations that expanded as
 a result of revivalist Protestantism. Second, tensions were generated by the
 demand that an Anglican bishop be established in the colonies. Many evan-
 gelicals found in this plan evidence that the British government wanted fur-
 ther control over the colonies. Third, the Quebec Act, enacted by Parliament
 in 1774, not only angered American colonists by nullifying their claims to
 western lands, but also heightened religious prejudice in the colonies by grant-
 ing tolerance to Roman Catholics. Fourth, ministers played a signiﬁcant role
 in encouraging their parishioners to support the independence movement.
 Olmstead claims that Congregationalist, Presbyterian, Dutch Reformed, and
 Baptist ministers overwhelmingly defended this revolutionary movement in
 the colonies. Finally, many of the revolutionaries, imbued with the Ameri-
 can sense of mission, believed that God was ordaining their revolutionary
 activities.
        Further support for these views can be found in Alan Heimert, Religion and
 the American Mind from the Great Awakening to the Revolution (Cambridge Uni-
 versity Press, 1966); Cedric B. Cowing, The Great Awakening and the American
 Revolution: Colonial Thought in the Eighteenth Century (University of Chicago,
 1971); Richard Hofstadter, America at 1750: A Social Portrait (Knopf, 1973); Rhys
 Isaac, The Transformation of Virginia, 1740–1790 (University of North Carolina
 Press, 1982); Ruth H. Bloch, Visionary Republic (Cambridge University Press,
 1985); Patricia U. Bonomi, Under the Cope of Heaven: Religion, Society, and Poli-
 tics in Colonial America (Oxford University Press, 1986); Harry S. Stout, The New
 England Soul: Preaching and Religious Culture in Colonial New England (Oxford
 University Press, 1986); and Mark A. Noll, Christians in the American Revolution
 (Regent College Publishing, 2006). Jon Butler has expanded his views on the
 colonial religious experience in Awash in a Sea of Faith: Christianizing the Ameri-
 can People (Harvard University Press, 1990).
        In the following selections, Thomas S. Kidd writes from the traditional
 assumption that a powerful revivalist force known as the “Great Awakening”
 occurred in the American colonies in the mid-eighteenth century. Recognizing
 that these revivals began before 1740 and continued well into the Revolution-
 ary era, Kidd focuses on the activities of George Whiteﬁeld in the early 1740s.
 In his essay, Kidd challenges Jon Butler’s contention that the inﬂuence of the
 Great Awakening was limited to New England and produced little change in
 colonial American religion. In contrast, Kidd argues that the Great Awakening
 produced a powerful impact in the colonies and sparked a rise in evangelical
 fervor that would have signiﬁcant implications for global Christianity.
        Jon Butler claims that historians, by accepting without much question
 the existence of the Great Awakening, have become accomplices in Napoleon’s
 insistence that “history is fable agreed upon.” Closer scrutiny of these revivals,

                                    



                                                         
says Butler, reveals that they were regional episodes that did not affect all of
the colonies equally and, hence, had only a modest impact on American colo-
nial religion. Because the mid-eighteenth-century revivals did not produce
the kinds of dramatic changes—religious or political—frequently ascribed
to them, Butler suggests that historians should abandon the concept of the
“Great Awakening” altogether.




                               



 ...  Until 1982, historians took the Great Awakening as a given, but then
 historian Jon Butler argued that it was only an “interpretative ﬁction” invented
 by nineteenth-century Christian historians. Although Butler’s argument was
 overextended, it helpfully provoked a revaluation of what we actually mean by
 “the Great Awakening.” He contended that the event really amounted to just
 “a short-lived Calvinist revival in New England during the early 1740s.” No
 doubt the eighteenth-century awakenings were centered in New England, but
 over time they came to inﬂuence parts of all the colonies, and more important,
 they helped birth an enormously important religious movement, evangelical-
 ism, which shows no sign of disappearing today.
       Butler also asserted that the “revivals had modest effects on colonial reli-
 gion” and that they were “never radical.” But if the revivals helped create
 evangelicalism, then not only did the awakenings make a profound change in
 colonial religion, but they began a major alteration of global Christian history.
 Moreover, . . . the revivals featured all manner of radical spiritual manifesta-
 tions, unnerving antirevivalists and moderate evangelicals alike. Butler’s critique
 does show, however, that it is not enough to evaluate evangelicalism as a
 homogenous whole. It had radical implications, but those implications were
 hotly contested by moderates, and its social potential often came to naught
 for women, African Americans, and Native Americans. Some evangelicals also
 began a great assault on the churchly establishments of colonial America, and
 the revolutionary move for disestablishment on the federal and state levels
 can largely be attributed to evangelical and deist cooperation in favor of the
 separation of church and state.
       Butler ﬁnally claimed that, contrary to the suggestions of previous schol-
 ars, “the link between the revivals and the American Revolution is virtually
 nonexistent.” . . . I am in substantial agreement with Butler on this point.
 Moreover, evangelicals’ responses to the Revolution covered the whole range of
 opinions from enthusiastic Patriotism to staunch Loyalism. But we should also
 note that evangelical rhetoric and ideology helped to inspire and justify the
 Patriot cause for both evangelical and nonevangelical leaders. Evangelicalism


did not start the Revolution, but the Patriot side certainly beneﬁted from the
support of many evangelicals.
  . . . I contend that there was, indeed, a powerful, unprecedented series
of revivals from about 1740 to 1743 that touched many of the colonies and
that contemporaries remembered for decades as a special visitation of the
Holy Spirit. Calling this event “the” Great Awakening does present historical
problems. Chief among them is that the standard framework of the “First”
and “Second” Great Awakenings may obscure the fact that the evangelical
movement continued to develop after 1743 and before 1800. There were
important, widespread revivals that happened before the First, and between
the First and Second, Great Awakenings. . . . I examine, instead, what we
might call the long First Great Awakening and the contest to deﬁne its bound-
aries. Although many revivals, including the major season from 1740 to 1743,
happened during this period, revivals alone did not delineate the early evan-
gelical movement. Instead, persistent desires for revival, widespread indi-
vidual conversions, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit distinguished the
new evangelicals. The long First Great Awakening started before Jonathan
Edwards’s 1734–35 Northampton revival and lasted roughly through the end
of the American Revolution, when disestablishment, theological change, and
a new round of growth started the (even more imprecise) “Second” Great
Awakening. The controversial emergence of the religion of the new birth
demarcated the long First Great Awakening and the ﬁrst generation of
American evangelical Christianity.
  . . . New Englanders began to hear about George Whiteﬁeld in 1739,
and many hoped that he would soon visit them. Benjamin Colman of
Boston’s Brattle Street Church wrote to Whiteﬁeld in December 1739 after
having received a letter from him. Whiteﬁeld estimated that he might
come to New England by summer 1740. Colman was deeply impressed by
what he had learned about Whiteﬁeld. He had read Whiteﬁeld’s Journals,
as well as some of his sermons. Colman wrote that he had never encoun-
tered anything comparable to Whiteﬁeld’s ministry, although he had wit-
nessed “uncommon Operations of the holy Spirit . . . ; as in our Country of
Hampshire of late; the Narrative of which by Mr. Edwards, I suppose you may
have seen.” If Whiteﬁeld would come to New England, he would ﬁnd the
churches’ Calvinist doctrine to his liking, “how short soever we may come
of your Fervours.” Colman told him that the churches had been praying for
him publicly, and that when he arrived he could use the commodious Brattle
Street Church for meetings. In a letter to Gilbert Tennent, Whiteﬁeld wrote
that he found Colman’s published sermons “acute and pointed, but I think not
searching enough by many degrees.” If anything, Colman was too polite for
Whiteﬁeld. Nevertheless, Whiteﬁeld wrote back to Colman and promised that
when he came to New England “I shall endeavour to recommend an universal
charity amongst all the true members of CHRIST’s mystical body.” Because of
this universal spirit, he suggested that he might stay in the ﬁelds to preach,
and out of the meetinghouses. He appreciated Colman’s latitudinarianism,
and they both hoped that the old division of Anglican versus dissenter would
become irrelevant in light of the ministry of the new birth.

                      

       Jonathan Edwards also received word of Whiteﬁeld’s revivals, and in
 November 1739 Whiteﬁeld wrote to him, desiring to visit Northampton to
 see for himself the fruit of the 1734–35 awakening. Edwards wrote back in
 February 1740, encouraging Whiteﬁeld to travel to Northampton but warning
 him not to expect much. Edwards was heartened by God’s raising up Whiteﬁeld
 in the Church of England “to revive the mysterious, spiritual, despised, and
 exploded doctrines of the gospel.” This might be a sign of the coming King-
 dom of God, Edwards thought.
       The Boston and Philadelphia newspapers began picking up stories about
 Whiteﬁeld’s prodigious meetings in England in spring 1739, and Whiteﬁeld’s
 fame began to spread into the hinterlands by early 1740. For instance, pastor
 Nicholas Gilman of Exeter, New Hampshire, on a visit to Boston, began reading
 Whiteﬁeld’s Journals in mid-January 1740 and commented with admiration on
 Whiteﬁeld’s “most Indefatigable labours to Advance the Kingdom of Christ.” He
 borrowed more of Whiteﬁeld’s sermons from Colman. In June, Gilman noted
 that “Mr. Whiteﬁeld [was] Now much the Subject of Conversations.”
       In July, Whiteﬁeld wrote to Colman to announce that he was coming soon,
 perhaps within a month, and to ask Colman to spread the word in friendly churches.
 This advance publicity worked wonderfully, and when Whiteﬁeld arrived in
 Newport. Rhode Island, on September 14, 1740, New England was abuzz with talk
 of his coming. In Newport, Whiteﬁeld was welcomed by Nathaniel Clap, a vener-
 able Congregational minister, and the wandering Jonathan Barber of Oysterponds,
 Long Island. Whiteﬁeld had earlier written the disconsolate Barber, telling him
 that he did not presume to judge whatever dealings God had with him. As for his
 visionary experiences, “I rather rejoice in them, having myself been blessed with
 many experiences of the like nature.” He told Barber to expect persecution when
 God dealt with him in extraordinary ways. These encouraging words led Barber
 to come to Newport to receive Whiteﬁeld. Upon meeting, they agreed that Barber
 would become part of Whiteﬁeld’s entourage.
       After some successes in preaching, particularly at Clap’s meetinghouse,
 Whiteﬁeld traveled north to Boston, where he arrived on September 18. Boston
 was the largest town in the colonies but still only a small provincial capital with
 about 17,000 people. In 1740, it was in decline, and it would slowly lose popu-
 lation up through the American Revolution. War with Spain, and later with
 France, left many widows in Boston, and the city faced high taxes and inﬂation.
 The poor in Boston were many, and they responded exuberantly to Whiteﬁeld,
 as they would to the radical piety of James Davenport and others.
       As usual, Whiteﬁeld met with Anglican authorities in Boston, most nota-
 bly the Commissary Timothy Cutler, the former Congregationalist rector of
 Yale turned Anglican “apostate.” Cutler was the most formidable proponent
 of Anglicanism in the colonies, and he and Whiteﬁeld did not see eye to eye
 about Whiteﬁeld’s relationship with non-Anglicans. Cutler argued that dis-
 senters had no legitimate ordination because they did not follow in the line
 of apostolic succession. Whiteﬁeld thought their ordinations were legitimate,
 primarily because they preached the new birth: “I saw regenerate souls among
 the Baptists, among the Presbyterians, among the Independents, and among
 the Church folks—all children of God, and yet all born again in a different






way of worship,” he told Cutler. Whiteﬁeld was able to leave Cutler on friendly
terms, but he would receive a much warmer welcome among the Congrega-
tionalists, especially from Benjamin Colman. After visiting Cutler he preached
at the Brattle Street Church to about four thousand.
  Whiteﬁeld spoke from supporters’ Boston pulpits as well as on Boston
Common. On September 20, he preached at Joseph Sewall’s Old South
Church to about six thousand, and in the afternoon he addressed a crowd
at the common that he estimated at eight thousand, although the papers
guessed ﬁve thousand. The next day he attended Sunday morning services at
the Brattle Street Church and spoke at Thomas Foxcroft’s Old Brick Church
in the afternoon. The crowd pressing to see him was so large that he went
out to the common again and preached to an enormous assembly he totaled
at ﬁfteen thousand, close to the whole population of Boston (the newspa-
pers guessed eight thousand). On Monday morning he sermonized at John
Webb’s New North Church to about six thousand. Then, in the afternoon,
tragedy struck the tour. At Samuel Checklcy’s New South Church, the sound
of a breaking board in the gallery triggered a stampede among the overﬂow
crowd. A number of people were severely trampled, and some jumped from
the balcony. Five people died. Whiteﬁeld decided to go on with the message
he planned to deliver, only moving out to the common. No doubt this sug-
gested insensitivity in Whiteﬁeld’s character, but the crowd wanted him to go
on, and one could hardly imagine a better moment for people to contemplate
their mortality.
  Whiteﬁeld visited Harvard and was not impressed with the size of the
school or its spirit. He noted that “bad books,” such as those by John Tillotson
and Samuel Clarke, defenders of natural religion, were popular there, not the
Puritan classics. Whiteﬁeld would later regret his harsh assessment of Harvard
and Yale and would become a great supporter of the colleges. Whiteﬁeld also
toured neighboring towns, including Roxbury and Charlestown, in his cir-
cuit. On September 27, Whiteﬁeld preached to one of his greatest crowds yet,
ﬁfteen thousand, on the common. Many were deeply affected, and Whiteﬁeld
himself wrote that he felt like shouting, “This is no other than the House
of God and the Gate of Heaven.” Boston Common had become a portal to
divine glory.
  Whiteﬁeld began taking collections for the Bethesda Orphanage, and the
number of pounds given was truly remarkable: perhaps £3,000 in local currency.
Boston outpaced collections even in London. On September 28 alone, he col-
lected more than £1,000 in services at the Old South and Brattle Street churches.
After speaking at Brattle Street in the afternoon, Whiteﬁeld held two private
meetings that showed the breadth of his appeal. The ﬁrst was with the governor,
Jonathan Belcher, who was an evangelical supporter of Whiteﬁeld. The second
was with “a great number of negroes,” who requested a private session with him.
He preached to them on the conversion of the Ethiopian in Acts 8.
  Whiteﬁeld visited towns up the coast from Boston from September 29 to
October 6, ﬁnding some successes but also a great deal of passivity. Maine and
New Hampshire had a substantial revival tradition, having seen large numbers
of conversions and admissions to full communion in the 1727–28 earthquake




 awakening, and to a lesser extent in 1735–36 as a devastating “throat distem-
 per” (diphtheria) raged there. He preached as far north as York, Maine, at the
 church of the well-respected Samuel Moody. His northern tour gave Nicholas
 Gilman of Exeter, who had been reading Whiteﬁeld’s Journals and sermons for
 almost a year, a chance to meet him. Gilman was perhaps not as adulatory in
 his initial response to Whiteﬁeld as one might expect, noting that “there are
 Various Conjectures about Mr. Whiteﬁeld,” but expressing hope that he truly
 was “a Man of an Excellent Spirit.” Whiteﬁeld’s appearance precipitated a con-
 version crisis for Gilman, as well, and set him on the path to becoming one
 of the most radical of New England’s evangelicals. Whiteﬁeld won some nota-
 ble converts in Maine, especially John Rogers. The pastor at Kittery, Rogers
 had been in the ministry for thirty years when he heard Whiteﬁeld, but he
 had never experienced conversion. Whiteﬁeld’s ministry convinced him of
 his need for the new birth, and afterwards he became one of Whiteﬁeld’s
 foremost proponents in Maine. Rogers’s son Daniel, a tutor at Harvard, would
 soon join Whiteﬁeld’s entourage and seek his own assurance of salvation. The
 revivals in Maine and New Hampshire would not begin in force until late
 1741, however.
       Returning to Boston, Whiteﬁeld continued seeing large audiences, but
 he also gravitated toward Tennent’s confrontational style as he spoke against
 unconverted ministers. “I am persuaded,” he wrote in his journal, “[that] the
 generality of preachers talk of an unknown and unfelt Christ.” He felt ener-
 gized by confronting the unsaved clergy: “Unspeakable freedom God gave
 me while treating on this head.” Although some of the ministers may have
 grown uneasy at such talk, Whiteﬁeld drew ever-larger crowds, until he ﬁnally
 announced a farewell sermon on October 12, which drew a crowd estimated
 at twenty thousand. If reasonably accurate, this was the largest crowd ever
 assembled in America up to that time.
       From Boston, Whiteﬁeld traveled west through New England. Delivering
 on his promise, Whiteﬁeld went slightly out of his way to visit Northampton.
 It was a poignant occasion for Edwards, who had waited ﬁve long years
 for revival ﬁre to reignite in Northampton. Edwards shed tears during
 Whiteﬁeld’s preaching. Whiteﬁeld, too, was deeply affected by his visit and
 impressed with Edwards’s wife and children, who seemed to him models
 of piety and propriety. Whiteﬁeld’s preaching in Northampton reached a
 crescendo on the Sabbath, as “Mr. Edwards wept during the whole time of
 exercise” in the morning. “Mr. Whiteﬁeld’s sermons were suitable to the cir-
 cumstances of the town,” Edwards wrote later to Thomas Prince, “contain-
 ing just reproofs of our back-slidings.” He reported to Whiteﬁeld that the
 revival bore lasting fruit, including the conversion of some of the Edwardses’
 children. Immediately after Whiteﬁeld’s departure, however, Edwards did
 begin a sermon series on the parable of the sower (Matthew 13), including
 warnings that short-lived episodes of heated preaching and crying did not
 make for saving religion. He subtly warned that Whiteﬁeld’s brand of reviv-
 alism was ripe for religious hypocrisy. Edwards would continue to support
 Whiteﬁeld, but he insisted that Northampton would experience revival on
 his terms.







   Accompanied by Edwards, Whiteﬁeld made his way south to East Windsor,
the home of Edwards’s parents. Along the way Whiteﬁeld kept preaching on
unconverted ministers, and at one point Edwards cautioned Whiteﬁeld about
not judging other ministers too harshly or trying to ascertain whether they
were converted. Edwards supported Whiteﬁeld overall, but he certainly had
doubts about the emotionalism and rash judgments that seemed to character-
ize the itinerant’s ministry. In East Windsor, Whiteﬁeld preached to Timothy
Edwards’s congregation and then visited the elderly pastor and his wife Esther
Stoddard Edwards, sharing supper and staying the night in their home.
   Out of Whiteﬁeld’s journey through Connecticut came two remarkable
testimonies of conversion. The ﬁrst was from the East Windsor saddler Samuel
Belcher. Though Belcher grew up in the family of Joseph Belcher, pastor at Ded-
ham, Massachusetts, he became “Cold and Dull” in matters of salvation, and
though he experienced some concerns for his soul before 1740, they had not
lasted. Whiteﬁeld’s arrival signaled the beginning of a six-month-long conversion
crisis. When “mr Whiteﬁeld p[re]ached here, . . . I was Greatly effected with his
preaching both here and att Hartford,” Belcher wrote. Belcher grew cold again,
but then in April he met a man in Lebanon, Connecticut, who told of the revival
there, which deeply impressed him. Then pastors Eleazar Wheelock of Lebanon
and Benjamin Pomeroy of Hebron preached at East Windsor, and Belcher fell
under deeper convictions than ever before. He felt the terrors of sin and the
threat of damnation, “but God was pleased to enable me to Cry mightily unto
him in the bitterness of my Soul for mercy in and through Jesus Christ.” While
he was praying, “I felt my Load Go of and my mouth was Stopt and I Could not
utter one word for Some time and I felt as if my heart was Changed.” When
Belcher could speak again, he began praising God and he knew he had been
saved. For Belcher, Whiteﬁeld’s exhortations began the conversion process, but
Wheelock’s and Pomeroy’s preaching, and his own prayers, ﬁnished the ordeal.
   Whiteﬁeld’s appearance also represented a beginning point for the conver-
sion of Nathan Cole, a farmer and carpenter from Kensington, Connecticut.
Cole grew up as what he called an “Arminian,” likely meaning that he casually
assumed that good works would save him. He began to hear reports about White-
ﬁeld’s tour, and he “longed to see and hear him, and wished he would come this
way.” News arrived in October that Whiteﬁeld had left Boston for Northampton.
Then on October 23, a messenger arrived and told him that Whiteﬁeld was com-
ing to nearby Middletown later that morning. Cole ran in from the ﬁeld to tell
his wife that they were leaving immediately, fearing they would not have time to
get there. As they neared the road to Middletown, he wrote that


   I saw before me a Cloud or fogg rising; I ﬁrst thought it came from the
   great River, but as I came nearer the Road, I heard a noise something like a
   low rumbling thunder and presently found it was the noise of Horses feet
   coming down the Road and this Cloud was a Cloud of dust. . . . I could
   see men and horses Sliping along in the Cloud like shadows . . . every
   horse seemed to go with all his might to carry his rider to hear news from
   heaven for the saving of Souls, it made me tremble to see the Sight, how
   the world was in a Struggle.




 When they arrived at the Middletown meeting house, Cole guessed that per-
 haps three or four thousand had assembled there, the countryside having
 emptied of its residents. Then Whiteﬁeld came to the scaffold:

        He Looked almost angelical; a young, Slim, slender, youth before some
        thousands of people with a bold undaunted Countenance . . . he looked
        as if he was Cloathed with authority from the Great God. . . . And my
        hearing him preach, gave me a heart wound; By Gods blessing: my old
        Foundation was broken up, and I saw that my righteousness would not
        save me; then I was convinced of the doctrine of Election: and went
        right to quarrelling with God about it; because that all I could do would
        not save me; and he had decreed from Eternity who should be saved
        and who not.

       Cole’s “quarrelling” with God lasted almost two years. Like Jonathan
 Edwards, he wrestled with the doctrine of predestination, thinking it abhor-
 rent, while at the same time wondering if he himself was damned. “Hell ﬁre
 was most always in my mind; and I have hundreds of times put my ﬁngers into
 my pipe when I have been smoaking to feel how ﬁre felt.” In the midst of his
 fears of hell’s torments, however, God gave him a vision:

        God appeared unto me and made me Skringe: before whose face the
        heavens and the earth ﬂed away; and I was Shrinked into nothing; I
        knew not whether I was in the body or out, I seemed to hang in open Air
        before God, and he seemed to Speak to me in an angry and Sovereign
        way what won’t you trust your Soul with God; My heart answered O yes,
        yes, yes. . . . Now while my Soul was viewing God, my ﬂeshly part was
        working imaginations and saw many things which I will omitt to tell
        at this time. . . . When God appeared to me every thing vanished and
        was gone in the twinkling of an Eye, as quick as A ﬂash of lightning; But
        when God disappeared or in some measure withdrew, every thing was
        in its place again and I was on my Bed. My heart was broken; my burden
        was fallen of[f] my mind; I was set free, my distress was gone.


 Cole’s long conversion culminated, as it did for many early evangelicals, with
 a vision of God.
       In New Haven, Whiteﬁeld visited with Rector Thomas Clap, who would
 later become one of his most bitter opponents. For now, Whiteﬁeld received a
 universally polite, if not entirely zealous, reception at Yale, despite his speak-
 ing to the students about “the dreadful ill consequences of an unconverted
 ministry.” Whiteﬁeld then continued toward New York, and when he reached
 the border, he evaluated New England as impressive because of its godly herit-
 age, but he feared that “Many, nay most that preach . . . do not experimen-
 tally know Christ.” He loved the excitement his visit generated, though, and
 he thought New England was pliable enough for true revival. Pastor William
 Gaylord of Wilton, Connecticut, brother-in-law of James Davenport, wrote
 that many thought Whiteﬁeld “has a Touch of Enthusiasm” but that over-
 heatedness could be forgiven more easily than lukewarmness. He believed





Whiteﬁeld’s most profound effect might have been “stirring up” the ministers
themselves, though he did have reservations about Whiteﬁeld’s comments on
unconverted ministers. Much of the power of Whiteﬁeld’s tours lay in his abil-
ity to excite the local ministers to more fervent gospel preaching.
  As Whiteﬁeld’s band crossed into New York, the Harvard tutor Daniel
Rogers came to the spiritual awakening he had sought during weeks of travel.
After a meeting at King’s Bridge (now a part of the Bronx), Rogers wrote,
“It pleased God of his free Sovreign Grace to come into my poor Soul with
Power and so to ﬁll me with Peace: yea with Such Joy in the Holy Ghost as
I never Experienced before—I cd not forbear Smiling nay Laughing for Joy
and Gladness of Heart.” Rogers shared the news with an elated Whiteﬁeld, but
soon after Satan was tormenting Rogers with “Abominable Horrible Shocking
Tho’ts.” Assurance was not always easily gained by the new evangelicals. . . .
  Whiteﬁeld continued to preach with considerable success in New York
City, then moved on to Staten Island where he rendezvoused with Gilbert
Tennent and John Cross. Tennent told him of his recent itineration through
south Jersey, Delaware, and northern Maryland, while Cross reported that he
had recently “seen great and wonderful things in his congregations.” They
arrived at Cross’s Basking Ridge congregation on November 5, where James
Davenport had been preaching in the morning. At an affecting afternoon serv-
ice, Daniel Rogers recalled that a nine- or ten-year-old boy began speaking
loudly, at which time Whiteﬁeld called on the crowd “to hear this Lad preach-
ing to them.” This led to a “General motion” during which many cried out,
some fainted, and some fell into ﬁts. A young man near Rogers was so moved
that he had to lean on Rogers during much of the sermon until he ﬁnally fell
to his knees.
  The large crowd then retired to Cross’s barn for the evening lecture. Ten-
nent preached ﬁrst, followed by Whiteﬁeld. Whiteﬁeld estimated that he had
spoken for six minutes when one man began to shout, “He is come, He is
come!” (Rogers recalled the man as crying “I have found him!”) Many oth-
ers began crying out “for the like favour,” and Whiteﬁeld stopped to pray
over them, which only heightened their fervent emotions. Rogers struggled to
adequately describe the meeting, but noted that many were “weeping, Sigh-
ing, Groaning, Sobbing, screaching, crying out.” The ministers ﬁnally retired,
but Rogers and Davenport returned at one o’clock in the morning to resume
preaching. Many in the congregation stayed up all night in the barn, praying
and worshipping. “Tis a night to be remembered,” Rogers wrote.
  The next morning many penitents approached the departing Whiteﬁeld,
including a “poor negro woman,” a slave, who asked to join his entourage.
Her master actually agreed to this idea (it is unlikely that he had permanent
emancipation in mind), but Whiteﬁeld told her to go home and “serve her
present master.” Whiteﬁeld and most white evangelicals were unprepared to
let the social implications of his gospel run a course to abolitionism. . . .
  . . . Whiteﬁeld’s tour moved on to New Brunswick, where Whiteﬁeld
began telling Gilbert Tennent and Daniel Rogers to go to New England to
follow up on the work there. Tennent initially refused, but after encourage-
ment from Whiteﬁeld and an apparent vote by the entourage, Tennent agreed.

 Whiteﬁeld headed south with Davenport while Rogers and Tennent began
 planning their new tours. In Philadelphia, Whiteﬁeld began preaching in the
 so-called New Building, a structure erected by supporters speciﬁcally for his
 visits. The one-hundred-by-seventy-foot building became Whiteﬁeld’s usual
 pulpit in Philadelphia, and though the fervor of his earlier visit had abated,
 wondrous visitations continued. At one meeting, many reported experiencing
 the sensation of being pierced by “pointed arrows” as he preached, and a
 young woman fell down senseless during the meeting and had to be carried
 home. On another occasion Whiteﬁeld reported that he spontaneously spoke
 against “reasoning unbelievers,” and he later found out that “a number of
 them were present” at his sermon. He attributed his well-timed admonition to
 the leading of the Holy Ghost.
        Through November, Whiteﬁeld continued his tour of southern New
 Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland, making stops at friendly
 congregations in Whiteclay Creek, Fagg’s Manor, Nottingham, and Bohemia
 Manor. Whiteﬁeld, as was often the case, fell terribly ill at Fagg’s Manor, writ-
 ing that “straining caused me to vomit much.” But he continued preaching
 and praying, and “soon every person in the room seemed to be under great
 impressions, sighing and weeping.” On December 1, Whiteﬁeld departed for
 South Carolina and Georgia, noting with satisfaction that he had preached
 perhaps one hundred seventy-ﬁve times since he arrived in Rhode Island two-
 and-a-half months earlier. The presence of God that attended his meetings
 convinced him that the British American provinces would remain his “chief
 scene for action.” The fall 1740 tour had been a gigantic success for Whiteﬁeld.
 His method of theatrical ﬁeld preaching rejuvenated New England’s substan-
 tial revival tradition and captivated tens of thousands of listeners. His incau-
 tious remarks about unconverted ministers, however, and his friendship with
 such ﬁgures as Tennent, Davenport, and Cross laid the groundwork for great
 controversies concerning the awakenings in the years ahead.




I  n the last half century, the Great Awakening has assumed a major role in
explaining the political and social evolution of prerevolutionary American
society. Historians have argued, variously, that the Awakening severed intellec-
tual and philosophical connections between America and Europe (Perry
Miller), that it was a major vehicle of early lower-class protest ( John C. Miller,
Rhys Isaac, and Gary B. Nash), that it was a means by which New England
Puritans became Yankees (Richard L. Bushman), that it was the ﬁrst “intercolo-
nial movement” to stir “the people of several colonies on a matter of common
emotional concern” (Richard Hofstadter following William Warren Sweet), or
that it involved “a rebirth of the localistic impulse” (Kenneth Lockridge).
  American historians also have increasingly linked the Awakening directly
to the Revolution. Alan Heimert has tagged it as the source of a Calvinist polit-
ical ideology that irretrievably shaped eighteenth-century American society
and the Revolution it produced. Harry S. Stout has argued that the Awakening
stimulated a new system of mass communications that increased the colonists’
political awareness and reduced their deference to elite groups prior to the
Revolution. Isaac and Nash have described the Awakening as the source of a
simpler, non-Calvinist protest rhetoric that reinforced revolutionary ideology
in disparate places, among them Virginia and the northern port cities. William
G. McLoughlin has even claimed that the Great Awakening was nothing less
than “the Key to the American Revolution.”
  These claims for the signiﬁcance of the Great Awakening come from more
than specialists in the colonial period. They are a ubiquitous feature of American
history survey texts, where the increased emphasis on social history has made
these claims especially useful in interpreting early American society to twentieth
-century students. Virtually all texts treat the Great Awakening as a major
watershed in the maturation of prerevolutionary American society. The Great
Republic terms the Awakening “the greatest event in the history of religion in
eighteenth-century America.” The National Experience argues that the Awakening
brought “religious experiences to thousands of people in every rank of society”
and in every region. The Essentials of American History stresses how the Awakening
“aroused a spirit of humanitarianism,” “encouraged the notion of equal rights,”
